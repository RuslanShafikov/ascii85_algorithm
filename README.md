## Description
This is ASCII85 decoder/ encoder.
To run the program you should enter one of the following keys:
1.) "ascii85 -e" or "ascii85" to encode to ascii85.
2.) "ascii85 -d" to decode
3.) Also you can use command "-q" to quit from the programm.

Program works simply and smoothly: when you entering encode mode you should enter the phrase you want to encode to ascii85. Then program will show you the expected result.
The same way works decoding funtion. You enter the phrase you want to decode in ascii85. Then get your output. Dont forget that ascii85 symbols might be differeent from the initial one.
